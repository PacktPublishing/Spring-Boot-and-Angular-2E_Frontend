This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.0.3 and enhanced using AI-assisted development workflows.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v24.2.0 or higher)
- Angular CLI v20.0.3
- VS Code with Angular Language Service extension
- GitHub Copilot extension (recommended for AI assistance)
- Copilot Chat extension (for interactive AI assistance)

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

1. Install Angular Material (if not already installed):

```bash
ng add @angular/material
```

## AI-Assisted Development Workflow

### Using GitHub Copilot for Development

1. **Project Instructions**: Configure project-specific AI context and coding standards
1. **Inline Code Completion**: Let Copilot suggest code as you type
1. **Chat Modes**:
   - Use inline chat for quick fixes and suggestions
   - Use sidebar chat for detailed explanations and complex problem-solving
   - Use agent mode for autonomous multi-step tasks
1. **Code Generation**: Use prompts to generate components, services, and tests

### Generating Mock Data with AI

Use Copilot to generate realistic book data:

```typescript
// Ask Copilot: "Generate an array of 20 book objects with realistic data"
// The AI will provide diverse, realistic book data for testing
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## AI-Powered Code Scaffolding

Use AI assistance for generating new components:

```bash
# Generate component with Copilot assistance
ng generate component component-name
# Then use Copilot Chat to enhance the generated component
```

For AI-assisted scaffolding patterns:

```bash
ng generate --help
# Use Copilot Chat to understand available options and best practices
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## AI-Enhanced Unit Testing

This project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit testing, enhanced with AI-assisted test generation and coverage improvement.

### Running Tests with AI Assistance

To execute unit tests, use:

```bash
npm run test
```

### AI-Assisted Test Generation

Use GitHub Copilot to:

1. **Generate Test Cases**: Ask Copilot to create comprehensive test suites
1. **Improve Coverage**: Identify missing test scenarios using AI analysis
1. **Mock Data Creation**: Generate realistic test data for various scenarios
1. **Edge Case Discovery**: Use AI to identify potential edge cases

### Available Test Commands

- **Interactive mode**: `npm run test` - Run tests with file watching and AI-assisted debugging
- **Single run**: `npm run test:run` - Run tests once with coverage analysis
- **UI mode**: `npm run test:ui` - Run tests with Vitest's web UI for visual debugging
- **Coverage**: `npm run test:coverage` - Run tests with AI-enhanced coverage reporting

### AI-Enhanced Testing Setup

The project uses:

- **Vitest**: Fast unit test framework with AI integration
- **@analogjs/vitest-angular**: Angular testing utilities optimized for AI-assisted workflows
