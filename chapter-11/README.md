- Pattern recognition and best practice enforcement
- Automated documentation generation

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.0.3 and enhanced using AI-assisted development workflows.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v24.2.0 or higher)
- Angular CLI v20.0.3
- VS Code with Angular Language Service extension
- GitHub Copilot extension (recommended for AI assistance)
- Copilot Chat extension (for interactive AI assistance)

### Installation

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## AI-Assisted Development Workflow

### Using GitHub Copilot for Development

1. **Project Instructions**: Configure project-specific AI context and coding standards  
1. **Inline Code Completion**: Let Copilot suggest code as you type
1. **Code Generation**: Use prompts to generate components, services, and tests

### Generating Mock Data with AI

Use Copilot to generate realistic book data:

```typescript
// Ask Copilot: "Generate an array of 20 book objects with realistic data"
// The AI will provide diverse, realistic book data for testing
```

## AI-Enhanced Unit Testing

This project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit testing, enhanced with AI-assisted test generation and comprehensive coverage improvement. The testing setup includes robust patterns for Angular Material components, signal-based testing, and Vitest-specific syntax.

### Comprehensive Testing Features

- **Vitest Integration**: Modern testing framework with `vi.spyOn()` syntax for robust spying
- **Angular Material Testing**: Specialized patterns for Material components with DOM fallback strategies
- **Signal-Based Testing**: Complete coverage of Angular's modern signal APIs for input/output testing
- **Component Interaction Testing**: Comprehensive click interaction and event emission validation
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Empty state handling, null checks, and error boundary testing
- **Accessibility Testing**: Screen reader compatibility and semantic HTML validation
- **Mock Data Patterns**: Realistic test data generation with multiple scenarios

### Enhanced Test Patterns

The project implements comprehensive testing standards covering:

- **Standalone Component Setup**: Proper TestBed configuration with Material module imports
- **Robust DOM Testing**: Fallback patterns when Material components don't fully render in tests
- **Event Testing**: Complete validation of user interactions and component outputs
- **Data Formatting**: Currency pipes, date formatting, and content validation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing elements and edge cases

### Running Tests with AI Assistance

To execute unit tests, use:

```bash
npm run test
```

### AI-Assisted Test Generation

Use GitHub Copilot to:

1. **Generate Comprehensive Test Suites**: Create complete test coverage including rendering, interactions, and edge cases
1. **Improve Testing Patterns**: Implement robust Vitest patterns with proper spy syntax and Material component handling
1. **Mock Data Creation**: Generate realistic, diverse test data for various testing scenarios
1. **Edge Case Discovery**: Identify and test empty states, null conditions, and error boundaries
1. **Accessibility Testing**: Create tests for screen reader compatibility and semantic HTML validation
1. **Component Interaction Testing**: Generate tests for click handlers, event emissions, and user workflows

### Available Test Commands

- **Interactive mode**: `npm run test` - Run tests with file watching and AI-assisted debugging
- **Single run**: `npm run test:run` - Run tests once with coverage analysis
- **UI mode**: `npm run test:ui` - Run tests with Vitest's web UI for visual debugging
- **Coverage**: `npm run test:coverage` - Run tests with AI-enhanced coverage reporting

### AI-Enhanced Testing Setup

The project uses:
