This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.0.3.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v24.2.0 or higher)
- Angular CLI v20.0.3
- VS Code with Angular Language Service extension (recommended)

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

1. Install Angular Material (if not already installed):

```bash
ng add @angular/material
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## Additional Resources

## Project Structure

The application follows Angular best practices with a clear separation of concerns, focusing on authentication and form management:

## Key Form Implementation Highlights

### Signup Form Features

- **Multi-level Validation**: Field-level, group-level, and cross-field validation
- **Custom Validators**:
  - `noNumbersValidator()` - Prevents numbers in name fields
  - `passwordMatchValidator()` - Ensures password confirmation matches
  - `minimumAgeValidator()` - Verifies users meet age requirements
- **Nested Form Groups**: Organized password and address sections
- **Dynamic Arrays**: User can add/remove favorite book genres
- **Real-time Feedback**: Password strength indicator and instant validation messages
- **Signal Integration**: Form state converted to reactive signals for optimal performance

### Book Create Form Features

- **Business Logic Validation**: Industry-specific validation patterns
- **Custom Validators**:
  - `isbnValidator()` - Validates ISBN-10 and ISBN-13 formats
  - `positiveNumberValidator()` - Ensures numerical values are positive
  - `urlValidator()` - Validates cover image URLs
- **Grouped Form Structure**: Organized into basic info and additional info sections

### Advanced Validation Patterns

```typescript
// Complex password validation with multiple criteria
password: this.fb.control('', {
  validators: [
    Validators.required, 
    Validators.minLength(8), 
    Validators.pattern(/^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])/)
  ]
})

// Cross-field validation for password matching
passwords: this.fb.group({
  password: ['', validators],
  confirmPassword: ['', Validators.required]
}, { validators: [passwordMatchValidator()] })

// Business-specific validation for ISBN
isbn: this.fb.control('', {
  validators: [isbnValidator()],
  nonNullable: true
})

// Custom validator for positive numbers with max constraints
price: this.fb.control<number | null>(null, {
  validators: [Validators.required, positiveNumberValidator()]
})
```

## Chapter Summary

This chapter provided comprehensive coverage of Angular reactive forms through practical implementation of authentication and book management components. Key accomplishments include:

- **Mastered Reactive Forms**: Implemented `FormGroup`, `FormBuilder`, and `formControlName` directives for robust data binding across multiple form types
- **Advanced Form Patterns**: Created nested form groups for complex data structures (passwords, addresses, basic/additional info)
- **Dynamic Form Arrays**: Built flexible forms that handle variable-length data (favorite genres)
- **Custom Validation Logic**: Developed validators for business rules (age verification, password matching, ISBN validation, URL validation)
- **Signal-Based Integration**: Converted form state to reactive signals for optimal performance and user experience
- **Professional UI**: Integrated Angular Material components for consistent, accessible form interfaces including dialog integration
- **Business Domain Validation**: Implemented industry-specific validators for book management (ISBN, pricing, publication years)
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Established clear patterns manually, then leveraged VS Code Copilot to efficiently scale across components

The comprehensive signup form and book create form showcase enterprise-level form handling with real-time validation, business logic enforcement, and sophisticated user interaction patterns that provide immediate feedback while maintaining code quality and architectural consistency.

## Next Steps

Building on this reactive forms foundation, you're prepared for:

- **State Management**: Advanced application state management with signals and stores
- **HTTP Services**: API integration for form data submission and validation
- **Advanced Routing**: Route guards and form state preservation
- **Testing Strategies**: Unit testing reactive forms and custom validators
- **Performance Optimization**: Form state management at scale

In the next chapter, we will explore the concepts and implementation of state management in Angular applications, discussing signals and store patterns and how they can improve application architecture.
